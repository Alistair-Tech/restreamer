You want to buy you a network camera and want to know what is needed for operation with Restreamer?  

The following basic data should be a function in your camera:

1. [RTSP](rtsp-camera-buyersguide.html) protocol  
2. [H.264](h264-camera-buyersguide.html) video output  
3. Network connection via WiFi / LAN / 3G / 4G / WAN 

720p (1280x720 px) resolution is a good measure of streaming video on the internet. YouTube & Ustream accept any video live streams at 720p or higher.
