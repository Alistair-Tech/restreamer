# Video4Linux

Video4Linux or V4L is a video capture and output device API and driver framework for the Linux kernel, supporting many USB webcams, TV tuners, and other devices. Video4Linux is closely integrated with the Linux kernel. Video4Linux was named after Video for Windows (which is sometimes abbreviated "V4W"), but is not technically related to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video4Linux" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
