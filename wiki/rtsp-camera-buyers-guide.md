#RTSP
The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers issue VCR-style commands, such as play and pause, to facilitate real-time control of playback of media files from the server. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
