title: Iris Control / Auto Iris
---

An auto iris adjusts to the ever-changing light under outdoor conditions like the human eye. When the sun shines, the iris closes automatically
so that less light to the image processor falls. Is it, for example darker through a cloud, it opens the iris to allow more light to come in. 

There are in addition to the auto-iris still: Fixed Iris, Manual Iris and P-Iris.

Only Auto-Iris allows camera using a in outdoor areas. Without this feature, a camera is not suitable for all light conditions and not for
perfect outdoor use.
