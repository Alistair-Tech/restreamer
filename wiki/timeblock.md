title: Time Block
---

The manufacturers of PTZ cameras (eg AXIS Communications) work with "Time Block". This is a protective function of the hardware to protect the
pan-tilt motor from continuous movements. The hardware is for a specific time (Time) completely inhibited (blocked).

Only Speed Dome cameras have no time block lock.

If you are using classical [PTZ](ptz.html) cameras take a look at the length of the "Time Block" use imperative to examine how long the lock and
when you start.

The "Time Block" in dome cameras can be up to 60 minutes, the camera does not responde in this time. AXIS Communications Dome cameras have a 20
minute time block.
