#Camera Buyers Guide
You want to buy you a network camera and want to know what is needed for operation with Datarhei/Restreamer?  

The following basic data should be a function in your camera:  
**1. [RTSP](../wiki/rtsp-camera-buyers-guide.html) protocol**  
**2. [H.264](../wiki/h264-camera-buyers-guide.html) video output**  
**3. Network connection via WiFi / LAN / 3G / 4G / WAN**  

**Datarhei Hint** ☺ ► 720p (1280x720 px) resolution is a good measure of streaming video on the internet. YouTube & Ustream accept any video live streams at 720p or higher.

#### A list with Raspberry Pi stuff, network cameras (USB, Indoor/Outdoor-Wifi, Static Indoor/Outdoor, Outdoor-PTZ) and accessories for your Datarhei/Restreamer camera project could be found [here](../wiki/guide-buy-hardware.html). 

**Build your own DIY IP-Camera with Datarhei/Restreamer**
