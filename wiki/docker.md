title: Docker

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers,
by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux.
Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow
independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining
virtual machines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

How to run Restreamer in Docker is explained in our [Docs](../docs/installation-index.html).
