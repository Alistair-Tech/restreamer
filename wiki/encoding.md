title: Encoding
---

Encoding is the process in which an existing video format is converted into another. You can use either a software (e.g. [FFmpeg](ffmpeg.html)) or specialized hardware.  

We recomment you this [article about encoding](http://www.heywatchencoding.com/what-is-video-encoding).

If you want to encode with Restreamer, make sure that your hardware has enough CPU power available. We will gladly help you look for the correct
encoding settings.
