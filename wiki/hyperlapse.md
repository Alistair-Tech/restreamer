Hyperlapse (also walklapse, spacelapse, stop-motion time-lapse, moving timelapse) is a technique in time-lapse photography that allows
the photographer to create motion shots. In its simplest form, a hyperlapse is achieved by manually moving the camera a short distance
between each shot. The first film using the hyperlapse technique dates to 1995.
