# Snapshot

A snapshot is called 1 single frame from a video. If you take 1 frame the result is a photo-like image. Mostly in jpg or png format. Many camera manufacturers support the Snapshot format over a particular function (keyword: [API](../wiki/api.html) over CGI.
In Screenshottet snapshots ot of videos the generated image looks sometimes spongy / blurred.  

You should always be trying to use the API function of the camera manufacturer, as the quality of the snapshot is higher.
