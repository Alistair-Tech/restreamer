#Case Studys
These projects shows how user people use Datarhei/Restreamer for outdoor or indoor installaions. If you want to see your unique case please let us know and we present it here or on Instructables.

###Foreword
At first it is always a good choice to think about your unique setup. Think 5 minutes and take a relaxed look what the smartest way might be for the installation. We recommend to do this before drilling holes in walls, installing network cables trough your house or mounting hardware parts outside your house or start buying unusefull expenisve hardware. It always helps even if you have bigger setups than in this case to make your project successful.

Dont forget: Ready-made network cables have a plugs at both ends. If you drill holes with the width of the cable you could not get the plug through this hole. You need not ready-made network cable on a roll like 50 meters or cut the plugs of your ready made cable off to crimp it after laying it. Otherwise you the holes for your cables might be very big and ugly.

It is always a good idea to test the complete function of the hardware indoor bevore installing it. Connect all parts of your setup to your network and check it everything is working like it should after the installation is done.  

**CAUTION! Be carefull electricity is very DANGEROUS and could burn down your property or cause death! We recommend to ask a electrician for 230V installations if you need to lay own power supply lines for your installation! Try always to prefer POE cameras without electricity construction work**
