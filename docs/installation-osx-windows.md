## Customs to embed the player upon your website

If you want to embed the video player upon your website, you have to forward the port generated by Kitematic (Docker Toolbox) on your host-system and your router.
Next a small example for Kitematic/VirtualBox:

1. Select a custom port like 31000:

3. Select the tab "network" and click on the button "port-forwarding"
   <img src="../img/vbox-port-2.png" width="95%">
4. Create new rule and paste the copyed port-number into "host-port" and "guest-port"

5. Save this changes by closing alls the windows with "OK"
6. Open the Restreamer upon your browser by "http://127.0.0.1:31000" to verify the changes

To setup the port-forwarding in your router model you have to read the manual.
