## Requirements

## Installation

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). You have to login in order to start the download.
2. Open Kitematic
   ![Kitematic](../img/kitematic.png)
3. Search for "restreamer" and select the "restreamer" image without "arm-"-tag:
   ![Kitematic Search](../img/kitematic-restreamer-search.png)
4. Finally Kitematic is running the Restreamer container:
   ![Kitematic Started](../img/kitematic-restreamer-started.png)
5. Open the Restreamer user interface by clicking on "WEB PREVIEW":
   ![Restreamer Login](../img/restreamer-login.png)
   
The default login is:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `datarhei`

It is highly recommended to change the username and password.

## Important customizations

1. Click on the volume path and "Enable volumes". This allows Restreamer to store the current state in a place where it can be restored when you restart the container:
   ![Kitematic Volumes](../img/kitematic-restreamer-volumes.png)
2. We highly recommend to change your password and username:
   ![Kitematic Password](../img/kitematic-restreamer-password.png)

## Customization to embed the player on your website

If you want to embed the video player on your website, you have to forward the port of Restreamer generated by Kitematic from your router to your host system.

1. Select a custom port like 32000:
   ![Kitematic Port](../img/kitematic-restreamer-port.png)
2. Open the Restreamer in your browser by entering `http://127.0.0.1:32000` in the URL bar

3. To setup the [port forwarding](../wiki/portforwarding.html) in your router, please check your router's the manual.
