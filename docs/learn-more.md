### How do I realise video streaming without Datarhei/Restreamer?  

The classic way is the data transfer with a streaming provider who collects monthly fees. Some services are supported by advertising, others additionally sell you their own hardware. Some companies then sell your live stream in content syndication campaigns, too. As a result you lose the control of your video content. The added value of the so-called "content syndication" is not measurable for you in most cases. Datarhei/Restreamer allows you to transfer H.264 video in TV quality to your own website without these middlemen. You are free to choose your hardware for yourself, the use is free of charge and you remain in possession of your videodata!
