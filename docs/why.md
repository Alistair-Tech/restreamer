## The Classic Way

The classic way is to transfer the live video data to a streaming provider who collects monthly fees. Some services are supported by advertising, others
additionally sell you their own hardware. Some companies then sell your live stream in content syndication campaigns. As a result, you
lose the control of your own video content. The added value of the so-called "content syndication" is not measurable for you in most cases.

## The Restreamer Way

Restreamer allows you to transfer H.264 video in HD quality to your own website without streaming providers. You are free to choose
your hardware for yourself, the use is free of charge and you remain in possession of your videodata! Restreamer does not charge monthly fees
and the streaming is completely free, because it uses your own internet connection. You will be your own video streaming provider.
Restreamer is open source and it is free to use for both private and commercial use.
